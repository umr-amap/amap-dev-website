This repository contains the source code of the website of `amap-dev` group of the AMAP laboratory.

This website is created using [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org).

To render the website, you can simply:

```bash
# preview the website in the current directory
quarto preview
# render the website in the current directory (but no preview)

```

or use the dedicated shortcuts of the IDE.
