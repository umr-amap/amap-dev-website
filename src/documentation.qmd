## DESCRIPTION file

For your entire project, you will need a DESCRIPTION file which gather the project metadata, for instance:

```
> Package: mypackage
> Title: What the Package Does (One Line, Title Case) \
> Version: 0.0.0.1000 \
> Authors@R:
    person("First", "Last", , "first.last@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
           comment = c(ORCID = "YOUR-ORCID-ID")) \
> Description: What the package does (one paragraph). \
> Imports: Rpackage1, Rpackage2 (the list of R packages that are needed to run your analysis)
```

Some of these sections may be edited by hand, but others are automatically generated by `devtools` or `usethis` packages.

## Function documentation: basics

- What is needed in the function documentation?
1. what does your function do
2. with which arguments
3. what does it return
4. (maybe) some examples of how to use it

- Here is an example of header for the custom 'add' function:
```r
#' Add together two numbers
#'
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A number.
#' @returns A numeric vector.
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

You can add many options to your documentation, such as:
  - `@export` to make the function available to the user
  - `@importFrom` to import a function from a package
  - `@seealso` to refer to other functions

- Write both function and documentation at the same time in `my-function.R` file, stored in R sub-repository.

- Use `roxygen` to generate `man/my-function.Rd`, reading the header: the `devtools` function `document()`
```r
devtools::document()
```
will generate (or update) your packageâ€™s `.Rd` files

## Package documentation

For a more "integrated" documentation of your package, that details the functions, datasets, and other objects in your package, you can use [vignettes](https://r-pkgs.org/vignettes.html) that can generate webpages with interactive code, results, plots and comments, and [pkgdown](https://r-pkgs.org/website.html) to create a website for your package.

Also see [CI/CI page](ci_cd.qmd) to automate vignette and website publishing.
