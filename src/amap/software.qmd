title: "Free and open-source software"
---

Proprietary softwares are still used at AMAP in particular, and academic research more generaly, despite the growing awareness of the benefits of open-source alternatives.

While historical reasons may explain the reliance on proprietary tools, the landscape is changing. Researchers are increasingly recognizing the importance of open-source solutions as reliable and sustainable options for their work.

## Proprietary software: why not use them ?

In academic research, the use of proprietary software can present several limitations:

- **Lack of transparency**: Proprietary software does not allow you to inspect or modify the source code, which can hinder reproducibility and scientific integrity.
- **Licensing costs and restrictions**: Licenses are often expensive and may limit the number of users or installations, which is problematic for collaborative and open research.
- **Sustainability and long-term access**: If a company discontinues a product or changes its licensing model, you may lose access to your tools or data formats.
- **Limited interoperability**: Proprietary formats can make it difficult to share data and methods with the broader scientific community.

For these reasons, our institution strongly encourages the use and development of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). FOSS promotes:

- **Transparency and reproducibility**: Anyone can inspect, modify, and share the code, which is essential for robust science.
- **Community-driven innovation**: Open-source projects benefit from contributions and peer review from researchers worldwide.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: FOSS is generally free to use, adapt, and distribute, reducing barriers for research teams.
- **Long-term sustainability**: Open standards and open code ensure that your research remains accessible and usable in the future.

By choosing FOSS, you contribute to a more open, collaborative, and sustainable scientific ecosystem, in line with the values and policies of academic institutions.

## Always-evolving list of proprietary software used and their alternatives

Here we intend to list proprietary software commonly used at AMAP and try to identify open-source alternatives that can be used in their place.

As for all the content of this website, any suggestion is welcome to keep this list up to date.

### Text editor

#### Online Latex editors

___Proprietary software___

[`Overleaf`](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an online collaborative LaTeX editor. It is widely used for writing and editing scientific documents. While

Free plan is available with limited features: only one collaborator, no git / github / Dropbox / Zotero integration, no document history, no track change, etc... Paid plans are much more in adequation with real case acedemic uses, but quite expensive.

___Open source alternatives___

[`plmlatex`](https://plmlatex.math.cnrs.fr/) . Based on the open-source version of Overleaf, hosted by `CNRS`. It is limited in the features it can offer compared to Overleaf's paid plan : no git / github integration and no track change, but multiple collaborators and version history are available. In summary, it is still not perfect, but a better option than `Overleaf`  free plan.

#### Online text editors

___Proprietary software___

While [`Google Docs`](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) is a popular online word processor, as being efficient and free of access, it is not open-source and may raise concerns regarding data privacy.

___Open source alternatives___

[`Fidus Writer`](https://www.fiduswriter.org/) . Open Source online editor developed for academia research, funded by european programs. Provides real-time collaboration, equations edition, multiple format exports (including latex), citations, offline edition, multiple plugins. Not tested at AMAP yet (as far as we know).

#### Local text editors

___Proprietary software___

Even if Microsoft Word is widely used in our community, it is a proprietary software that requires a paid license, using a closed-source model, with vendor lock-in.

___Open source alternatives___

[`LibreOffice Writer`](https://www.libreoffice.org/) . A powerful and free office suite, a successor to OpenOffice, with a large community of users and developers. It offers a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation software, and more. It is compatible with Microsoft Word formats (compatibility has increased a lot in recent years) and provides many advanced features, similar to Microsoft Word.

#### More general Open source alternatives

Even though this might require some technical skills at first, local editors in addition to `git` for version control can be an excellent option. Actualy, even if this workflow is adequate for `latex` edition, it can also be an excellent solution for writing documents in `markdown` (meaning a much more simple syntax, but still with a high degree of customization and using existing templates for most academic journals, *e.g.* using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)). This includes all per-default git version control and collaboration features. This comes with a drawback of some technical skills needed (mostly due to `git` usage).

Come and discuss with POLIS team to help you check if this can be the right solution for you.

## Geographic Information System (GIS)

#### Proprietary software

[`ArcGIS`](https://www.arcgis.com/) is a popular proprietary GIS software suite for working with maps and geographic information. It offers a wide range of tools for spatial analysis, data visualization, and map creation, but it requires a paid license and is not open-source.

#### Open source alternatives

[`QGIS`](https://qgis.org/) is a free and open-source GIS.
