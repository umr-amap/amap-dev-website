# R users

## Why do you need tests ?

## initial setup
```shell
usethis::use_testthat(3)
```
verify tests/testthat/ repo and tests/testthat.R file which is supposed to look like :
```shell
library(testthat)
library(pkg_name)

test_check("pkg_name")
```
No need to modify testthat.R file !

## create a test
- function in R/ repo my_function.R, the corresponding test must lie in tests/testthat/ repo and its name must start with "test", here test-my_function.R

## run a test
First devtools::load_all(), then :
- Ã  la main : testthat::test_file("tests/testthat/test-my-function.R")
- shortcut RStudio
- devtools::test() (ou check())

## examples
- expect_equal()
- expect_type()
- expect_length()
- ...

## when and what to test
- one test per function
- test-first philosophy
- test unitaire
- test coverage
- link with CI and github actions
