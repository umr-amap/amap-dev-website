# Welcome to the new `amap-dev` website!

Here you'll find resources on good programming practices, such as versioning or testing, but also on how to use a calculation cluster. This is a work in progress, more content will be added over the coming months.

If you have any questions or suggestions on the content do not hesitate to contact Thomas Arsouze (thomas.arsouze[at]cirad.fr) or Dominique Lamonica (dominique.lamonica[at]ird.fr) or Philippe Verley (philippe.verley[at]ird.fr). This is an open project, so feel free to contribute by opening a pull request [here](https://github.com/umr-amap/amap-dev-website/pulls)!
